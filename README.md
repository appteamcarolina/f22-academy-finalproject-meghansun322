## Additional
Final Project for App Team Carolina iOS Academy Fall 2022

Objectives:

- Have some sort of `@State` variable to create a dynamic user interface
- Have some sort of user input (`TextField`, `Picker`, `DatePicker`, etc)
- Use a binding (either with `@Binding` or interacting with a system component)
- `ForEach` with multiple reusable subviews
- Use at least one custom `struct` as a data model for building views
